# Not Yet Another eNgine Util

## Description
This repo contains various utilities for NYAN.
Primarily, logging, math and data structure utilities.

The math was primarily developed for NYAN with that in mind it leans on GLM and targets GLSL as well, but with the ability to adapt to modern Vulkan features (explicit matrix layout for Accelerations structures and possible HLSL target).
It is not supposed to be better than GLM but instead intended as a learning opportunity for c++ features and cmake practices.
